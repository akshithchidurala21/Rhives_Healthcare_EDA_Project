# Rhives_Healthcare_EDA_Project

This repository contains my Week 3 project for the Rhives Technologies Internship, where I performed an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the global Tuberculosis (TB) healthcare dataset. The analysis includes data preprocessing, visualizations, dashboards, and key insights to understand TB burden across countries and regions.

##  Project Files Included
- **Health care.ipynb** – Complete EDA notebook (cleaning, analysis, visualizations)
- **Rhives Healthcare Dataset.csv** – Original dataset used for the analysis
- **without duplicates_file.csv** – Cleaned dataset after removing duplicates
- **Week3 Dashboard.pdf** – Dashboard created using project visuals
- **Akshith_week3_task.pdf** – Final report submitted for evaluation
- **README.md** – Project documentation

##  Project Highlights
- Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis  
- Conducted univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis  
- Visualized TB trends using histograms, bar charts, violin plots, and regression plots  
- Identified high-burden regions and strong correlations among TB indicators  
- Prepared final dashboard summarizing key findings  

---

##  Key Insights
- TB deaths are highly right-skewed, with a few countries contributing to most fatalities  
- Strong correlation between TB incidence per 100k and deaths per 100k  
- Regional variations show significant differences in TB control and healthcare access  
- Data-driven insights can help target high-risk regions for better TB management

##  Tools & Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Jupyter Notebook
- PDF Dashboard (created manually using project visuals)
